        <p>The objective of this method is to find the intersection of a straight formed by points a and b with the x-axis, and to obtain new smaller intervals, which allows an approximation to a root.</p>
        <p>This method preserves all the characteristics and conditions that the bisection method has, except for the way to calculate the intermediate point of the interval</p>
        <p>The procedure to follow for applying the method is as follows:</p>
        <p> 1. If you have two points (a, f (a)) and (b, f (b)) and draw the line that joins these two points, you can see that one point is below the x-axis and another above this, and an intermediate point (Xm, 0), with this intermediate point you can compare the limits and obtain a new interval</p>
        <p>2. If f (A) and f (B) < 0, then the root is on the left side of the interval.</p>
        <p>3. If f (A) and f (B) > 0, then the root is on the right side of the interval.</p>
        <p>4. To find the intersection of the line with the X axis we use the following formula: Xm= a - ((f(a)*(b - a))/(f(b) - f(a)))</p>
        <p>"The False position method converges more quickly than the bisection method because when one of its initial values ​​remains fixed, the number of calculations is reduced while the other initial value converges towards the root.</p>
