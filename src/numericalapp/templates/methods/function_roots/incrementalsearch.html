      <h4><b>Incremental Search Method</b> <i style="font-size:24px" class="fa">&#xf059;</i> </h4>
      <p>
        The objective of this method is to find an interval that contains at least one root, 
        and is based on the intermediate value theorem.\n\nTo apply this method the function f(x) must be 
        real and continue, in addition, care must be taken when choosing the increment (Delta) at which 
        the function will be evaluated, if the increment is very small there is a risk of returning the 
        process very expensive, and if it is very large there is a risk of not detecting the root.</p>
       <p>The procedure to follow for applying the method is as follows:</p>
       <p> 1. A domain of the function of interest is determined</p>
       <p> 2. The function is evaluated by taking a small increment and an initial value (Xo) selected 
           arbitrarily from the domain.</p>
       <p> 3. Analyze the sign of the product of the evolution of a current value with the previous
            one and deduce with it whether or not the root exists. If the sign of the product is negative, 
            an interval containing the root can be confirmed as confirmed, otherwise the interval doesnÂ´t exist.</p>
